       <br />You will need to establish a wireless local area network (WLAN) to connect your client devices with this product wirelessly for accessing the Internet service that you have subscribed.
       <br />This product allows establishment of two wireless networks using two SSID. The Service Set Identifier (SSID) is the name of the wireless network broadcast from this product. In order for computers to connect to the local network over a wireless link, they must select this network name from the list detected of wireless networks in the area.
       <br />
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; List of Available Access Points: Information of the two wireless networks including its activating status, SSID, security status, active time, and the scheduled activating time that you had specified.
       <br />
       <br />To edit a wireless network:
       <br />1.	Mark the box of the network that you want to edit. Click the Edit button.
       <br />2.	The Wireless Configuration page pops up. Configure the following settings.
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; Enable SSID: Choose to Enable or Disable the function. (Note: when a schedule is established for this wireless network, choosing Enable or Disable here will not turning on or off this wireless network.)
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; SSID: The SSID of this product.
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; Broadcast SSID: Check the box if you want to broadcast this SSID. The SSID will be displayed when you search for available networks.
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; Security: Select one security method from the drop box. None: No protection, open mode. WPA/WPA2/WPA+WPA2 Personal: Enables wireless with personal wireless protected access mode. WEP: Enables wireless with WEP protection, provides a 5/13 character ASCII string to enable 64/128 bit encryption respectively.
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; Password: Specify a password for your wireless network.
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; Show Plain Password: Check the box to make the password visible.
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; Beacon Interval: Enter the time in milliseconds between beacon transmissions. The default interval is 100 milliseconds.
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; Fragmentation Threshold: This is the maximum length of the frame, in bytes, beyond which packets must be broken up (fragmented) into two or more frames. Collisions occur more often for long frames because while sending them they occupy the channel for a longer time. The default value is 2346, which effectively disables fragmentation.
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; RTS Threshold: The Request to Send (RTS) threshold is the packet size in bytes above which the product is required to check the transmitting frames to determine if RTS/Clear to Send (CTS) handshake is required with the receiving client. Using a small value causes RTS packets to be sent more often, consuming more of the available bandwidth, therefore reducing the apparent throughput of the network packets. The default value is 2346, which effectively disables RTS.
       <br />3.	Click Apply to activate your settings.
       <br />
       <br />To set schedule rule for a network:
       <br />1.	Mark the box of the network that you want to set a schedule. Click the SSID Schedule button.
       <br />2.	The Schedules page pops up. Click Add to add a new schedule rule.
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; Active Time: Mark the box to enable this schedule rule.
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; Schedule Name: Name of this schedule.
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; Start Time and Stop Time: The time that you want to turn on or off this wireless network.
       <br />3.	Click Apply to apply the changes.
       <br />
       <br />To perform access control through MAC filtering:
       <br />The function allows you to block or allow computer devices from establishing a wireless link to the product.
       <br />1. Mark the box of the network that you want to perform MAC filtering. Click the ACL button.
       <br />2. Select an ACL policy:
       <br />Allow Everybody: Allows all devices to connect to the product wirelessly regardless of the list of wireless computers defined below.
       <br />Allow: Allows devices that are added in the MAC address list to connect to the product.
       <br />Deny: Devices that are added in the MAC address list will be blocked when trying to connect to the product.
       <br />3. Click Apply.
       <br />4. Click the Add button to add MAC addresses that are going to apply this rule.
