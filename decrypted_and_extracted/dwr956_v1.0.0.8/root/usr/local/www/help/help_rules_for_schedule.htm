       <br />This section allows you to determine what local network users can access on the Internet, and when. Parental control profiles enable you to restrict access to particular websites or block sites with specific keywords that you do not want home network users to access. Parental control configuration is accomplished in two steps. First content filtering rules or schedules are defined and then a parental control profile is created using a combination of content filtering rules and schedules.
       <br />
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; Parental Control Settings: Check the box to enable parental control. You will be able to prevent local network computers from accessing undesirable content or connecting to the Internet during scheduled access times.
       <br />Click Apply to apply the changes. Or click Reset to undo your configurations.
       <br />
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; List of Parental Control Profiles: This section displays the parental control list you have set up. Click Add to add a profile, or select an item and click Edit to modify the items below:
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187;&#187; Profile Name: A unique identifier for the parental control profile.
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187;&#187; Description: This can be a short description of the purpose of the rule, to allow administrators of this product to remember in the future the use and intent of this profile.
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187;&#187; Group: The user group upon which the rule is applied.
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187;&#187; Enable Content Filtering and Filter Content: Mark the checkbox to enable content filtering. Select a rule from the drop list. You can add a rule by accessing Firewall > URL Blocking.

       <br />
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; List of Schedules: Schedules are a very useful feature to allow security files to be enabled or disabled based on the time of day or day of the week. Configured schedules are available for selection in the firewall rule configuration page. All schedules follow the configured system time. When you create a parental control policy, you have the option to specify a time of day and duration when the rule is active. The table lists all the Available Schedules for this device and allows several operations on the Schedules.
