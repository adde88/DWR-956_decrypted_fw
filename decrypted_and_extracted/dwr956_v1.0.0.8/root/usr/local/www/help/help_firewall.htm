       <br />This section displays the firewall security settings of this product. The security levels are grouped into a set of rules corresponding to maximum, typical, and minimum security settings. Advanced users can supplement these rules with custom parental controls or port mapping rules as needed. Select from one of the three security modes to protect the local network from Internet intrusion:
       <br />
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; Security Mode Configuration:
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187;&#187; Maximum Security: All incoming requests from the Internet are blocked by default and the router allows limited Internet destined traffic from leaving the local network. This mode is the strongest level of security. All traffic from the Internet is blocked from reaching the local network, except what is allowed via port mapping policies that apply to local network or DMZ computers. A limited set of commonly used services are permitted to be accessed from the local network such as web traffic (HTTP / HTTPS) or file transfer (FTP).
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187;&#187; Typical Security: All incoming requests from the Internet are still blocked by default but the computers on the local network can access the Internet without restrictions. This is the default and generally most appropriate security setting for home networks. All traffic from the Internet is blocked from reaching the local network, thus blocking unwanted intrusion from the outside. At the same time local network users are given unrestricted access to the Internet regardless of service or application.
       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187;&#187; No Security: This setting opens the firewall for all traffic to and from the Internet. This mode provides unrestricted access from local network to the Internet and vice-versa. It is not recommended to set this product in this mode without additional parental controls as it makes the local network vulnerable to attack from the Internet.
